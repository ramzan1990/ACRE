Absolute Concentration Robustness Exploration (ACRE)

The overall idea of ACRE is to enumerate all the biochemical reaction networks that consist of
user-created nodes from user-selected modules under user-specified constraints; to apply
Shinar and Feinberg's theorem; and to determine which of the networks have the absolute
concentration robustness (ACR) property.
